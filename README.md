# 🔁 Recursion Problems in C++

This repository covers recursive techniques and problems - starting from basic recursion to backtracking. Practicing recursion is essential for understanding Trees, Graphs, and DP later.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Print Name N times
- Print numbers 1 to N and vice versa and also using backtracking to print these.
- Factorial using Recursion by parameterized and functional way.
- Sum of first N numbers using Recursion by parameterized and functional way.
- Reverse Array using Recursion.
- Palindrome check using Recursion.
- x to power n using Recursion.

## 🧠 Learning Concepts

- Base and Recursive Cases
- Parameterized vs Functional Recursion
- Stack Space / Call Stack

## 🛠️ Language

- C++
- IDE: VSCode , Online Compiler
